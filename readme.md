this is a very basic to do app where the user has the ability to cross out and remove elements from a list


the app is responsive and uses flexbox and event listeners to make it work

the project may incorporate user login in the future, in order to save and continue their to do list from last time, maybe even have the functionality to save and view multiple lists per user
